# Mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing-Project

Project summary:
The aim of the project is to do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to the datasets and build a machine learning model using XGBoost.

Objectives
•	If for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero, then you need to remove those variable(s).
•	Check for null and unique values for test and train sets.
•	Apply label encoder.
•	Perform dimensionality reduction.
•	Predict your test_df values using XGBoost.
